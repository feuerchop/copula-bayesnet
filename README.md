### Towards Learning Directed Acyclic Graph of Copula Bayesian Networks

**Abstract**. Copula Bayesian networks are powerful probabilistic mod- els to represent multivariate continuous distributions, while comes along with a simpliﬁed parameter estimation with ﬂexible choices of univariate marginals. In particular form of Gaussian copula, model parameters can be eﬃciently estimated by inverse normal transformation. Nevertheless, learning the underlying causal graph remains problematic. In this paper, we propose a method for structure learning of copula Bayesian networks based on estimated precision matrix for copulas, named PreCBn. We show that the method gives good estimation of the networks and outperforms other related approaches of structure learning. The results indicate that the PreCBn is able to recover known causal relations more eﬃciently than existing approaches, and consequently results in graphical models with accurate structure and simpliﬁed model parameters.
